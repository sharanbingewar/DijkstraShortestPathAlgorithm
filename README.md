# DijkstraShortestPathAlgorithm
This project implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The graph uses non-negative weights for the edges, and the program returns both the minimum cost and the path for each vertex from the source.
